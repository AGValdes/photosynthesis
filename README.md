# Minimum Viable Product vs

### What will your MVP functionality be?
The user can search plants by name, family, ediblility, annnual/perennial, or flowering. The user can then select favorites and save them in a database to be rendered to the favorites page, where there will also be a link to google shopping so the user can find and purchase their favorite plants. The user can also save selections to a "my garden" page, where information about the care of that plant will be displayed from the database as well. On this page they will also be about to log notes about their gardening process for each plant and save those as well. 
### What are your stretch goals?
To allow notifcations to be sent to the user, allow user to upload pictures of their plants' progress, allow user to find plants using a reverse image search, allow user to actually purchase plants from the app UI as opposed to just being linked to google shopping.
